# EWOR - Education Platform Design, Group 9
#### Jon Zehnder, Philipp Scherrer, Gina Buzziol, Jana Bünder, Beat Scherrer

## Project description and customer needs
### Company Profile
- Best summarized as “a networking company”
- EWOR is an existing business that connects large corporations and entrepreneurs. It furthermore offers an own ecosystem that grants access to investors, founders, peers and most recently education. The education platform is not yet ready and expected to launch in 2020. It slightly changes EWOR’s target customer as described in the below material.
-Employ people to help them find a company => Provide community, office space, Investor Network, “employment opportunity” if startup fails
- Companies can invest in startups at EWOR (call options)
- They can also have an “innovation office” at EWOR ⇔ outsourcing risk
### Project Description
The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of customer needs and translate them into a prototype that works within the restrictions of ​learndash.com​ used to build the education platform. The focus of this project is to understand customer needs and iterate different UI/UX to appeal more to customers.

## Ideas
Start with the key requirements/needs of the users / the company
Then list your initial ideas (min. 3) with a brief description.
Upload the PPT presentation that you discussed with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

Optional: in this part you can document ideation and prototyping process (e.g. describe personas, show affinity clusters, etc. ) (Weeks 3-6)

### Affinity clustering
During the exercise session from **03/10/2019**, the information received during the stakeholder interview in the morning of the same day has been recapped. 
The team members wrote down one term or a short phrase on sticky notes.

</p>
By placing the sticky notes on the table the task has been divided into clusters and the problem has been reframed. The reframing of the problem leads to a guided solution search and a meaning of need-finding data is made.


As a learning from the exercise session and the affinity clustering we took, that the project task can be clustered as followed:
- Stakeholder vision 
- Platform User
- Content
- Module style/design
- Platform Architecture 
- Framework of EWOR

This clustering was helpful to further understand the projects goals and important framework.

### User Needs
To gain an understanding of the user-needs all team members contacted start-ups. The start-up creators have been interview to gain knowledge on what they would have expected if they would have had access to such a learning platform. 

The user needs are extracted from the common needs of the interviews conducted with start ups and pose the requirements for our platform:

General Needs:
- Mentoring
- Networking

Missing knowledge:
- Business creation (Legal, Employees, Insurances, business plan)
- Basic knowledge (keywords)

Platform Needs:
- Browser (PC)
- On-Demand
- Overview of current startup phase & progress
- Content according to phase
- Short videos
- Questions to check knowledge


### Idea Presentation
As an outcome of the ideation process and the user-needs, possible features for the learning platform were presented to the stakeholders. This project differs a bit from the other ones in the sense that the stakeholders themselves are still figuring out how the learning platform should look like contentwise.
The user-need identified in the start-up interview and the features presented were also helpful for the stakeholders to take further decisions.
In the slides presented to the stakeholders (that can be seen [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/Deliverables/Idea_Presentation_stakeholders.pptx)) the different possible ways to implement the features can be seen.

On the following picture, one example of the presented features can be seen.
Out of the user-need, missing basic knowledge (keywords) and content according to phase, we came up with the idea that somehow the current stage and interests of the platform-user can be discovered and like this, the user then receives suggestions to learn.

</p>

By presenting the stakeholders our insights and ideas, during the call, following new insights into the stakeholder's needs and their opinion about our ideas could be gained:

- Mentor has login for the platform as well
- Community should be present! Some kind of communication tool is wanted.
- Interest check idea should be followed up on, the questionnaire was not welcomed.
- Different types of progress should be visible (start-up phase user is in, knowledge in a specific field, etc.)
- Content projection is still in progress at EWOR itself. The suggested introduction video with additional reading material was welcomed.

## Evaluation
    TODO
Describe your approach for evaluating your low-fi prototypes, present your results and your conclusion. Upload the document shared with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here.

Optional: in this part you can also document the prototyping process: show different iterations, as well as failed ideas (Weeks 6-10)


## Final solution
    TODO
Describe your final solution to the problem and the prototype you developed in more detail here.
Upload your video to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

(Weeks 10-14)
