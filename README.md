# EWOR - Education Platform Design, Group 9
#### Jon Zehnder, Philipp Scherrer, Gina Buzziol, Jana Bünder, Beat Scherrer

## Project description and customer-needs
### Company Profile
- EWOR (Entrepreneurship WithOut Risks) is an existing business that connects large corporations and entrepreneurs. It furthermore offers an own ecosystem that grants access to investors, founders, peers and most recently education.
- EWOR wants to offer a substitution to a "classical" master of business administration (MBA). They would like to start a new programm in spring 2020 with an additional learning platform. The participants will be leaders of a start-up or an innovation lab in collaboration with a business partner. The business partner will provide a task or an idea for the start-up/innovation lab to realize.
- Companies can invest in start-ups at EWOR (call options)
- They can also have an “innovation office” at EWOR ⇔ outsourcing risk

### Education Platform - Motivation
The goal of EWOR is to offer an alternative way to "learn" entrepreneurship by  a "learning by doing" approach instead of studying it in theory at an university.
To provide their participants with the needed knowledge they want to create an education platform. This platform should be additional to the working experience and contain information about topics that the participants need in their training which they can access on demand. The use of the learning platform is not mandatory for the participants. The platform does not exist yet so we have to start from scratch and should diverse from university style (stakeholder need).

### Project Description
The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of customer-needs and translate them into a prototype that works within the restrictions of learndash.com used to build the education platform. The focus of this project is to understand customer-needs and iterate different UI/UX to appeal to customers.

## Ideas
### Affinity clustering
During the exercise session from **03/10/2019**, the information received during the stakeholder interview in the morning of the same day has been recapped. 
The team members wrote down a term or a short phrase on sticky notes. 

<p align="left" width="100%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/affinitycluster.jpeg?raw=true">         
</p>

By placing the sticky notes on the table the task has been divided into clusters and the problem has been reframed. The reframing of the problem leads to a guided solution search and a meaning of need-finding data is made.

As a result from the exercise session and the affinity clustering, the project task could be clustered as followed:
- Stakeholder vision 
- Platform User
- Content
- Module style/design
- Platform Architecture 
- Framework of EWOR

This clustering was helpful to further understand the projects goals and important framework. Successively to the affinity clustering, we were able to create three different personas that described their user needs respectively. The full description of the personas can be found [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/Deliverables/Personas.pdf).[PDF, 3 Pages]

### User-Needs
To gain an understanding of the user-needs all team members contacted start-ups. The start-up creators were interviewed to gain knowledge on what they would have expected if they would have had access to such a learning platform. 

The user-needs have been extracted from the common needs of the interviews conducted with start-ups and pose the requirements for our platform:

General Needs:
- Mentoring
- Networking

Missing knowledge:
- Business creation (legal, employees, insurances, business plan)
- Basic knowledge (keywords, technical terms)

Platform Needs:
- Browser (PC)
- On-Demand
- Overview of current start-up phase & progress
- Content according to phase
- Short videos
- Questions to check knowledge

### Ideation Process
The goal of the exercise session from **10/10/2019** was to hold a brainstorming session to collect ideas and various solution possibilities for the task at hand. These were then categorized into groups of subtasks, for example:
- Platform selection
- Onboarding experience and content structure
- Progress and reward tracking
- Content type (e.g. videos vs. text)

The complete list of possible feature and structure ideas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WuViY7FWu7IQ8LbECBP9XhBpRHZoaEtJjYyjS29tew/edit?usp=sharing) and in the image below.

<p align="left" width="100%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/IMG_4782.jpg?raw=true">             
</p>

In the meantime, all team members are still conducting interviews with start-up founders from different industries to get a better understanding of the priorities and necessities at hand.
Further tasks added include additional research into possible platforms, concept decisions and the preparation of concrete design ideas for a presentation to the shareholders.

### Idea Presentation
As an outcome of the ideation process and the user-needs, possible features for the learning platform were presented to the stakeholders. This project differs a bit from the other ones in the sense that the stakeholders themselves are still figuring out how the learning platform should look like contentwise.
The user-needs identified in the start-up interview and the features presented were also helpful for the stakeholders to take further decisions.
In the slides presented to the stakeholders (which can be seen [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/Deliverables/Idea_Presentation_stakeholders.pptx)) the different possibilities to implement the features can be seen.

On the following picture, one example of the presented features is shown.
With the user-needs "missing basic knowledge (keywords)" and "content according to phase" in mind, we came up with the idea that somehow the current stage and interests of the platform-user can be determined and according to these findings the user receives module suggestions for learning.

</p>


By presenting and discussing our insights and ideas in the call with our stakeholders, following new insights into the stakeholder-needs and their opinion about our ideas could be gained:

- Mentor has login for the platform as well
- Community should be present! Some kind of communication tool is wanted.
- Interest check idea should be followed up on, the questionnaire was not welcomed.
- Different types of progress should be visible (start-up phase user is in, knowledge in a specific field, etc.)
- Content projection is still in progress at EWOR itself. The suggested introduction video with additional reading material was welcomed.
   
   
## Evaluation
### Low-fi Prototypes
The task of the exercise session **24/10/2019** was prototyping. Prototyping helps to narrow down and test ideas. In a first phase, we only did low-fi paper prototypes since it would help to boost discussions and as the prototypes were only made out of paper it was more likely to throw an idea away if needed. It is also cost-and-time-effective. 
Since the time in the exercise session was not enough the team decided that all team members will continue doing paper prototypes at home. These prototypes will then be discussed during the team meeting of the **29/10/2019**. The prototypes for the different interest checks will be built with the help of PowerPoint but still kept low-fi.

### User Study
To understand the needs of the users, how intuitively the website design is and if all the features are necessary, a user study has been set up.

<p align="left" width="100%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/userstudy3.JPG?raw=true"> 
</p>

#### Content
In the user study, the following three topics have been examined:

##### Landing Page:
The landing page is the first page presented after logging into the platform. It should show an overview and lead to different features. One feature that was wished to be showed on the landing page by the stakeholders, for example, was the progress (project- and module completion-wise).
In the user study different ideas are tested on intuitivity and understanding. The question on how efficient the user is able to perform certain tasks on the UI has to be answered.

##### Interest Check:
One goal of the learning platform is to break free from academic boundaries and explore the content in a playful manner. Therefore, one feature of the platform is to suggest modules which the user is particularly interested in and encourage the user to study proposed modules. For that reason, three different low fidelity prototypes have been created to select the topics a user is interested in. These prototypes will be evaluated for their usability.

##### Communication Platform:
One stakeholder requirement states to have as much peer to peer interaction as possible. This is due to the fact that they want to create a community that is helping each other out and sharing their experiences as well as gaining networking experience. The interviews with potential users (i.e. successful and failed startup founders) also showed that a common need is to create or have access to a social business network.

#### Results
In this section a short description of some findings of the user study is found. **The full User Study Report and the presentation where the methods and results of the user study are discussed in detail can be seen [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/Deliverables/UserStudyReport-EWOR.pdf). [PDF, 16 Pages]; [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/Deliverables/User%20Study%20Presentation.pptx).[PPTX])**

##### Landing Page
We gained the understanding that the “Skills” section was not clear enough and that a spider-diagram to display the learning progress is not intuitive. The progress of the side quest studying is displayed with a bar, which was definately understood better. These conclusions are also supported by the evaluation of the timing data and the results of the landing page survey.
The course and module section was well understood and the participants were able to edit their courses and find courses they were asked to find. We also gained an understanding of the need for a challenge feature.

##### Interest Check
The interest check evaluation yielded a clear winner out of three interactive prototypes. Evaluating the different interest check prototypes with the SUS method was appropriate since it also focuses on repeated tasks which will be the case with the intended functionality of being able to adjust one’s interests at any point on the platform. Therefore the process should be efficient and completion times should be low. Further subjective questions were asked to get a feeling for the satisfaction of each prototype. The best SUS score and overall individual subjective rating has been proven to be the bubble selection approach. The completion times were the shortest on this prototype as well, which further endorses the choice.

##### Communication Tool
The survey on the communication tool and the participants’ experiences gave insight to high level needs and requirements to said feature. Even though no specific prototype has been evaluated important insights could be extracted from the survey. It could be of great importance to tackle some user needs identified in the initial need finding process (i.e. contact to mentor, networking) which has been conducted with potential users of the platform.
However, many users have not used a communication tool for their project due to already existing alternatives (e.g. slack, whatsapp, etc.) in the past. Therefore, a sophisticated integration to the platform and its tools might prove beneficial.


## Final solution
Before we describe our final solution, we proudly present our final video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZdpHfX0r0U_8gLQ11UY3akuBWJRPDVYe/view).

### The prototype we developed
With the knowledge the team gained through the user study, a new prototype has been created. This one would be the final prototype and was therefore designed as a high fidelity prototype on Adobe XD. Hereinafter, the different features of the prototype will be shown and explained.

The Landing page shows the main overview of the learning platform and should be as intuitive as possible. After the evaluation of the user study and the meeting with the stakeholders, a few changes have been made and the final prototype has been designed. 

#### Landing Page
<p align="left" width="100%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/Landing Page.png?raw=true"> 
</p>

- Rename “skills” to “skill progress” to adjust to the meaning of progress bars.
- Use progress bar instead of spider diagram for main quest phases.
- Course overview bigger: compared to the landing page of the paper-prototype the course section on the landing page of the final prototype takes in more space based on the feedback of the stakeholder. 
- From two buttons (my courses and all modules) to one button: instead of distinguishing, only one button (edit courses) has been implemented. This removes the confusion about the difference of courses and modules (there is none).
- Decision on using already existing communication platform (based on the outcome of the questionnaire in the user study and the last meeting with the stakeholder).
- The state of the phase can be changed.

#### Mentor contact
<p align="left" width="60%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/mentor.JPG?raw=true"> 
</p>

- The mentor button shows all the different ways a mentor agreed to be contacted by and the participant can choose which one to use. This gives them (both mentor and participant) the freedom to choose the way of interaction themselves.

#### Challenges and Leaderboard
<p align="left" width="80%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/challenges.JPG?raw=true"> 
</p>

- Leaderboard: By clicking on the crown button upcoming challenges are shown as well as a leaderboard where the participants can see how much they studied compared to the other participants of the EWOR program. 
- Adapted challenges: The challenges can be used to have an overview of the personal progress of the participant, e.g. completed phases or completed courses.

#### Course selection
<p align="left" width="100%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/filter.JPG?raw=true"> 
</p>

- Courses can be filtered according to the phases of the project, as well as “my courses” and also “mentor suggested courses”.

#### Course design
<p align="left" width="100%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/course.png?raw=true"> 
</p>

- The design of the courses has been done based on the restrictions given by learndash and the stakeholder.

#### Interest check
<p align="left" width="60%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/interest-check.JPG?raw=true"> 
</p>

- Interest check: based on the outcome of the user study, the bubble prototype has been improved and implemented on wordpress. The user can now do the interest check and get courses suggested based on his interests.

### Roadmap
Since the project is finished in a working state we provide a [roadmap](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) which summarizes the implementation details for built and also upcoming features. The roadmap should help EWOR to continue this project on the basis of our work and provide thoughts and discussions of used tools.

### Final Presentation
At the final presentation of the project, all delivered videos have been shown. Then the visitors of the presentation could come by and test the prototypes and see the work that has been done during the last semester.
