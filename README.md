# EWOR - Education Platform Design, Group 9
#### Jon Zehnder, Philipp Scherrer, Gina Buzziol, Jana Bünder, Beat Scherrer

## Project description and customer-needs
### Company Profile
- Best summarized as “a networking company”
- EWOR is an existing business that connects large corporations and entrepreneurs. It furthermore offers an own ecosystem that grants access to investors, founders, peers and most recently education. The education platform is not yet ready and expected to launch in 2020. It slightly changes EWOR’s target customer as described in the below material.
- Employ people to help them find a company => Provide community, office space, Investor Network, “employment opportunity” if start-up fails.
- Companies can invest in start-ups at EWOR (call options)
- They can also have an “innovation office” at EWOR ⇔ outsourcing risk

### Education Platform - Motivation
The goal of EWOR is to offer an alternative way to "learn" entrepreneurship by "learning by doing" instead of studying it in theory.
To provide their participants with the needed knowledge they want to create an education platform. This platform should be additional to the working experience and contain information about topics that the participants need in their training.

### Project Description
The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of customer-needs and translate them into a prototype that works within the restrictions of learndash.com used to build the education platform. The focus of this project is to understand customer-needs and iterate different UI/UX to appeal to customers.
 
## Time Line

</p>

## Ideas
Start with the key requirements/needs of the users / the company
Then list your initial ideas (min. 3) with a brief description.
Upload the PPT presentation that you discussed with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

Optional: in this part you can document ideation and prototyping process (e.g. describe personas, show affinity clusters, etc. ) (Weeks 3-6)

### Affinity clustering
During the exercise session from **03/10/2019**, the information received during the stakeholder interview in the morning of the same day has been recapped. 
The team members wrote down one term or a short phrase on sticky notes. 

<p align="left" width="100%">
  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/affinitycluster.jpeg?raw=true">         
</p>

By placing the sticky notes on the table the task has been divided into clusters and the problem has been reframed. The reframing of the problem leads to a guided solution search and a meaning of need-finding data is made.

As a learning from the exercise session and the affinity clustering we took, that the project task can be clustered as followed:
- Stakeholder vision 
- Platform User
- Content
- Module style/design
- Platform Architecture 
- Framework of EWOR

This clustering was helpful to further understand the projects goals and important framework.

### User-Needs
To gain an understanding of the user-needs all team members contacted start-ups. The start-up creators have been interview to gain knowledge on what they would have expected if they would have had access to such a learning platform. 

The user-needs are extracted from the common needs of the interviews conducted with start-ups and pose the requirements for our platform:

General Needs:
- Mentoring
- Networking

Missing knowledge:
- Business creation (Legal, Employees, Insurances, business plan)
- Basic knowledge (keywords)

Platform Needs:
- Browser (PC)
- On-Demand
- Overview of current start-up phase & progress
- Content according to phase
- Short videos
- Questions to check knowledge

### Ideation Process
The goal of the exercise session from **10/10/2019** was to hold a brainstorming session for collecting the ideas and various solution possibilities for the task at hand. These were then categorized into groups for all the subtasks, such as:
- Platform Selection
- Onboarding Experience and Content Structure
- Progress and Reward Tracking
- Content Type (e.g. Videos vs Text, etc.)

The complete list of possible feature and structure ideas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WuViY7FWu7IQ8LbECBP9XhBpRHZoaEtJjYyjS29tew/edit?usp=sharing) and in the image below.

</p>

In the meantime, all team members are still conducting interviews with start-up founders from different industries to get a better understanding of the priorities and necessities at hand.
Further tasks added include additional research into possible platforms, concept decisions and the preparation of concrete design ideas for a presentation to the shareholders.

### Idea Presentation
As an outcome of the ideation process and the user-needs, possible features for the learning platform were presented to the stakeholders. This project differs a bit from the other ones in the sense that the stakeholders themselves are still figuring out how the learning platform should look like contentwise.
The user-need identified in the start-up interview and the features presented were also helpful for the stakeholders to take further decisions.
In the slides presented to the stakeholders (that can be seen [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/Deliverables/Idea_Presentation_stakeholders.pptx)) the different possible ways to implement the features can be seen.

On the following picture, one example of the presented features can be seen.
Out of the user-need, missing basic knowledge (keywords) and content according to phase, we came up with the idea that somehow the current stage and interests of the platform-user can be discovered and like this, the user then receives suggestions to learn.

</p>


By presenting the stakeholders our insights and ideas, during the call, following new insights into the stakeholder's needs and their opinion about our ideas could be gained:

- Mentor has login for the platform as well
- Community should be present! Some kind of communication tool is wanted.
- Interest check idea should be followed up on, the questionnaire was not welcomed.
- Different types of progress should be visible (start-up phase user is in, knowledge in a specific field, etc.)
- Content projection is still in progress at EWOR itself. The suggested introduction video with additional reading material was welcomed.
   

## Evaluation
Describe your approach for evaluating your low-fi prototypes, present your results and your conclusion. Upload the document shared with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here.

Optional: in this part you can also document the prototyping process: show different iterations, as well as failed ideas (Weeks 6-10)
### Low-fi Prototypes
The task of the exercise session **24/10/2019** was to do prototyping. Prototyping helps to narrow down and test ideas. In a first phase, we only did low-fi, paper prototypes since this helps to boost discussions and since the prototypes are only made out of paper it is more likely to throw an idea away and it is cost-and-time-effective. 
Since the time in the exercise session was not enough the team decided that all team members continue doing paper prototypes at home, these prototypes will then be discussed during the team meeting of the **29/10/2019**.

### User Study
To understand the needs of the users, how intuitively the website design is and if all the features are necessary, a user study has been set up.

In the user study the following three topics have been examined:
- Landing Page
- Interest Check
- Communication Platform

The study has been conducted on 9 participants. Three different approaches have been chosen to gather insights on the three main topics to be investigated.

The User Study Report where the methods and results of the user study are discussed in detail can be seen [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/Deliverables/UserStudyReport-EWOR.pdf).

## Final solution
Before we describe our final solution in a blog entry, we proudly present our final video.
