# EWOR - Education Platform Design, Group 9
#### Jon Zehnder, Philipp Scherrer, Gina Buzziol, Jana Bünder, Beat Scherrer

## Project description and customer needs
### Company Profile
- Best summarized as “a networking company”
- EWOR is an existing business that connects large corporations and entrepreneurs. It furthermore offers an own ecosystem that grants access to investors, founders, peers and most recently education. The education platform is not yet ready and expected to launch in 2020. It slightly changes EWOR’s target customer as described in the below material.
-Employ people to help them find a company => Provide community, office space, Investor Network, “employment opportunity” if startup fails
- Companies can invest in startups at EWOR (call options)
- They can also have an “innovation office” at EWOR ⇔ outsourcing risk
### Project Description
The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of customer needs and translate them into a prototype that works within the restrictions of ​learndash.com​ used to build the education platform. The focus of this project is to understand customer needs and iterate different UI/UX to appeal more to customers.
 

## Time Line

  <img style="width:30%;align:left" src="https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/img/timeline2.JPG?raw=true">             
</p>

## Ideas
Start with the key requirements/needs of the users / the company
Then list your initial ideas (min. 3) with a brief description.
Upload the PPT presentation that you discussed with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

Optional: in this part you can document ideation and prototyping process (e.g. describe personas, show affinity clusters, etc. ) (Weeks 3-6)

### Affinity clustering
During the exercise session from 03/10/2019, the information received during the stakeholder interview in the morning of the same day has been recapped. 
The team members wrote down one term or a short phrase on sticky notes.

</p>
By placing the sticky notes on the table the task has been divided into clusters and the problem has been reframed. The reframing of the problem leads to a guided solution search and a meaning of needfinding data is made.

    
## Evaluation
    TODO
Describe your approach for evaluating your low-fi prototypes, present your results and your conclusion. 
Upload the document shared with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here.

Optional: in this part you can also document the prototyping process: show different iterations, as well as failed ideas (Weeks 6-10)

## Final solution
    TODO
Describe your final solution to the problem and the prototype you developed in more detail here.
Upload your video to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

(Weeks 10-14)
