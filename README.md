# EWOR - Education Platform Design, Group 9
#### Jon Zehnder, Philipp Scherrer, Gina Buzziol, Jana Bünder, Beat Scherrer

## Project description and customer needs
### Company Profile
- Best summarized as “a networking company”
- EWOR is an existing business that connects large corporations and entrepreneurs. It furthermore offers an own ecosystem that grants access to investors, founders, peers and most recently education. The education platform is not yet ready and expected to launch in 2020. It slightly changes EWOR’s target customer as described in the below material.
- Employ people to help them find a company => Provide community, office space, Investor Network, “employment opportunity” if startup fails.
- Companies can invest in startups at EWOR (call options)
- They can also have an “innovation office” at EWOR ⇔ outsourcing risk

### Education Platform - Motivation
The goal of EWOR is to offer an alternative way to "learn" entrepreneurship by "learning by doing" instead of studying it in theory.
To provide their participants with the needed knowledge they want to create an education platform. This platform should be additional to the working experience and contain information about topics that the participants need in their training.

### Project Description
The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of customer needs and translate them into a prototype that works within the restrictions of learndash.com used to build the education platform. The focus of this project is to understand customer needs and iterate different UI/UX to appeal to customers.

</p>

## Ideas
Start with the key requirements/needs of the users / the company
Then list your initial ideas (min. 3) with a brief description.
Upload the PPT presentation that you discussed with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

Optional: in this part you can document ideation and prototyping process (e.g. describe personas, show affinity clusters, etc. ) (Weeks 3-6)

### Affinity clustering
During the exercise session from 03/10/2019, the information received during the stakeholder interview in the morning of the same day has been recapped. 
The team members wrote down one term or a short phrase on sticky notes.

</p>
By placing the sticky notes on the table the task has been divided into clusters and the problem has been reframed. The reframing of the problem leads to a guided solution search and a meaning of needfinding data is made.

As a learning from the exercise session and the affinity clustering we took, that the project task can be clustered as followed:
- Stakeholder vision 
- Platform User
- Content
- Module style/design
- Platform Architecture 
- Framework of EWOR

This clustering was helpful to further understand the projects goals and important framework.

### Ideation Process
The goal of the exercise session on 10/10/2019 was to hold a brainstorming session for collecting the ideas and various solution possibilities for the task at hand. These were then categorized into groups for all the subtasks, such as:
- Platform Selection
- Onboarding Experience and Content Structure
- Progress and Reward Tracking
- Content Type (e.g. Videos vs Text, etc.)

The complete list of possible feature and structure ideas can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WuViY7FWu7IQ8LbECBP9XhBpRHZoaEtJjYyjS29tew/edit?usp=sharing) and in the image below.

</p>

In the meantime, all team members are still conducting interviews with startup founders from different industries to get a better understanding of the priorities and necessities at hand.
Further tasks added include additional research into possible platforms, concept decisions and the preparation of concrete design ideas for a presentation to the shareholders.
    
## Evaluation
    TODO
Describe your approach for evaluating your low-fi prototypes, present your results and your conclusion. 
Upload the document shared with the stakeholder to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here.

Optional: in this part you can also document the prototyping process: show different iterations, as well as failed ideas (Weeks 6-10)

After the ideation process and the start-up interviews we did, possible features for the learning platform were presented to the stakeholders. This project differs a bit from the other ones in the sense that the stakeholders themselves are still figuring out how the learning platform should look like contentwise. We could deliver some input to that as well, which they were really happy about. The slides we presented to the stakeholders can be seen [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group9/blob/master/Deliverables/Idea_Presentation_stakeholders.pptx). 
The main decisions that have been made in the call are the following:
- Mentor has login for the platform as well
- Community should be present! Some kind of communication tool is wanted.
- Interest check idea should be followed up on, questionnaire was not welcomed.
- Different types of progess should be visible (start-up phase user is in, knowledge in a specific field, etc.)
- Content projection is still in progress at EWOR itself. The suggested introduction video with additional reading material was welcomed.

## Final solution
    TODO
Describe your final solution to the problem and the prototype you developed in more detail here.
Upload your video to the "deliverables" folder and include the link here. 

(Weeks 10-14)
